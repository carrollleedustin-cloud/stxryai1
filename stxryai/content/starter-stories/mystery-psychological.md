I saw the murder. Or maybe I didn't. Or maybe I did, but it wasn't me who saw it.

My name is Sarah. Or sometimes it's Emma. Or Claire. It depends on who's asking and who's answering.

I have Dissociative Identity Disorder. Seven distinct personalities sharing one body, one life, one increasingly complicated existence. And three nights ago, one of us witnessed a murder.

The problem is, I don't know which one.

---

Dr. Martinez leans forward in her chair, her expression carefully neutral. We've been doing therapy together for five years, and she's gotten good at hiding her reactions. But I can see the concern in the tightness around her eyes.

"Walk me through it again, Sarah," she says. "What do you remember?"

"I remember waking up in an alley." My hands are shaking. I clasp them together to make them stop. "It was raining. There was blood on my clothes. And I had this feeling—this certainty—that something terrible had happened."

"But you don't remember what?"

"No. I lost time. Four hours, just... gone." I close my eyes, trying to pull up memories that aren't there. "But I found this in my pocket."

I pull out the photograph. It's crumpled, water-stained, but the image is clear enough: a man, middle-aged, lying in a pool of blood. His throat has been cut.

Dr. Martinez takes the photo with gloved hands—she's learned to be careful with evidence. "Have you shown this to the police?"

"And tell them what? That one of my personalities might have witnessed a murder but I don't know which one and I can't remember anything about it?" I laugh, and it sounds slightly hysterical even to my own ears. "They already think I'm crazy. This would just confirm it."

"You're not crazy, Sarah. You have a documented medical condition—"

"That makes me an unreliable witness at best and a suspect at worst." I stand up, pacing the small office. "What if I didn't just witness it? What if one of them did it?"

"Your alters aren't violent."

"That we know of." I stop pacing, meeting her eyes. "Dr. Martinez, I lose hours, sometimes days. I wake up in places I don't remember going to. I find things in my apartment that I don't remember buying. How do I know what any of them are capable of?"

Dr. Martinez is quiet for a long moment. Then she says, "I think we need to try hypnotherapy. See if we can access the memories from that night. Find out which alter was fronting and what they saw."

"And if what they saw was themselves committing murder?"

"Then we deal with that. Together." She stands, placing a gentle hand on my shoulder. "But Sarah, I've worked with you and your system for five years. I don't believe any of you are capable of murder. I think you witnessed something terrible, and your mind is trying to protect you from the trauma."

I want to believe her. But I've learned not to trust my own mind.

How can I trust hers?

---

The hypnotherapy session is scheduled for the next day. I spend the night in my apartment, trying to stay present, trying not to switch.

It doesn't work.

I come back to awareness at 3 AM, standing in my kitchen with a knife in my hand. There's a note on the counter in handwriting I don't recognize:

*He deserved it. -M*

M. That would be Marcus. He's the protector, the one who fronts when I'm in danger. He's also the one I know least about, the one who keeps secrets even from the rest of us.

My phone buzzes. A text from an unknown number:

*I know what you did. We need to talk. Riverside Park, 4 AM. Come alone.*

I should call Dr. Martinez. I should call the police. I should do anything except go to a deserted park at 4 AM to meet a stranger who knows about the murder.

I grab my coat and head for the door.

---

Riverside Park is empty at this hour, just shadows and the sound of water lapping against the shore. I walk to the meeting spot, my hand wrapped around the pepper spray in my pocket.

A figure emerges from the darkness. A woman, maybe forty, with tired eyes and a detective's badge clipped to her belt.

"Sarah Chen?" she asks.

"Detective...?"

"Morrison. Sarah Morrison." She studies me with an intensity that makes me want to disappear. "I've been investigating the murder of James Whitmore. Tech CEO, found dead in an alley three nights ago. Throat cut. And you were seen leaving the scene."

My heart stops. "I didn't—"

"I know you didn't." Detective Morrison pulls out a tablet, showing me security footage. I watch myself—or someone wearing my body—walk out of the alley, covered in blood. But the way I move is wrong. Too confident. Too purposeful. "That's not you, is it? That's one of your alters."

"How do you know about—"

"Because I have DID too." Morrison's smile is sad. "Takes one to know one. And I know that look. That's someone else driving."

I sink onto a nearby bench, my legs suddenly unable to hold me. "Which one?"

"I was hoping you could tell me." Morrison sits beside me. "Look, I don't think you—any of you—killed Whitmore. But I think you saw who did. And I think that's why you're in danger."

"What do you mean?"

"Whitmore was dirty. Embezzlement, fraud, connections to organized crime. Someone wanted him dead, and they're very good at covering their tracks." Morrison pulls up another image—a man in a suit, face partially obscured. "This is Victor Kane. He's a fixer for the Volkov crime family. And he was at the scene that night."

I stare at the image, and something clicks in my mind. A flash of memory that isn't mine:

*Running. Rain. A man with a knife. Another man screaming. Blood. So much blood.*

"Marcus," I whisper. "Marcus was there. He saw Kane kill Whitmore."

"Can you talk to Marcus? Get him to tell us what he saw?"

"It doesn't work like that. I can't just summon them. They come when they want to, when they're needed." I close my eyes, trying to reach inward, trying to find the others. "But I can try."

Dr. Martinez's office, 6 AM. Emergency session.

I'm sitting in the chair, but I'm not alone. I can feel them all, crowded at the edges of my consciousness. Emma, who holds the childhood trauma. Claire, who handles the day-to-day tasks. Marcus, the protector. And the others, whose names I'm still learning.

"Marcus," Dr. Martinez says gently. "If you're there, if you can hear me, we need your help. Sarah needs your help."

I feel the shift—that strange sensation of stepping back while someone else steps forward. When I open my eyes, it's not me looking out.

"I'm here." The voice is mine, but deeper, harder. Marcus.

Detective Morrison leans forward. "Marcus, I need you to tell me what you saw three nights ago."

"I saw a murder." Marcus's hands—my hands—clench into fists. "Sarah was walking home from work. She took a shortcut through the alley. Stupid, but she was tired. And then we heard it—a man screaming."

"What did you do?"

"I fronted. Took control. Sarah can't handle violence, but I can." Marcus's voice is matter-of-fact. "I saw Kane standing over Whitmore's body. Saw the knife. Saw the blood. And Kane saw me."

"Did he say anything?"

"He said, 'You didn't see anything.' And I said, 'No, sir.' And then I ran." Marcus looks at Morrison. "I took a photo. Evidence. In case... in case something happened to us. In case we needed proof."

"The photo in Sarah's pocket," I realize, my voice mixing with Marcus's.

"Yes. But Kane followed us. I could feel him watching. So I hid the body—Sarah's body—in a different alley. Made it look like we'd been mugged. Bought us time."

"Time for what?" Dr. Martinez asks.

"Time to figure out how to survive." Marcus meets her eyes. "Kane knows we saw him. He knows we're a witness. And he's going to kill us to keep us quiet."

The room is silent.

Then Detective Morrison says, "Not if we get him first."

---

The plan is insane. But then again, my entire life is insane, so why should this be different?

Morrison has been building a case against Kane for years, but she's never had enough evidence. The photo Marcus took isn't enough—it shows the aftermath, not the act. We need Kane to confess.

We need to wear a wire and get him to talk.

"This is dangerous," Dr. Martinez protests. "Sarah has a documented mental health condition. Any confession obtained this way could be challenged in court."

"Not if we have corroborating evidence," Morrison argues. "And not if Kane doesn't know about the DID. As far as he's concerned, Sarah is just a scared witness who wants to make a deal."

"And if he decides to kill her instead of talking?"

"Then I'll be there. Backup. Protection." Morrison looks at me. "But it's Sarah's choice. All of yours."

I close my eyes, reaching inward. Feeling for the others. Emma is scared. Claire is practical. Marcus is ready to fight. The others are quiet, waiting.

"We do it," I say. "We end this."

---

The meeting is set for midnight at an abandoned warehouse. Classic crime movie location, which would be funny if I wasn't terrified.

I'm wearing a wire under my jacket. Morrison is in a van two blocks away, listening. Marcus is close to the surface, ready to front if things go wrong.

Kane arrives exactly on time. He's smaller than I expected, ordinary-looking. The kind of man you'd pass on the street without a second glance.

"Miss Chen," he says pleasantly. "Thank you for agreeing to meet."

"You said you wanted to talk." My voice is steadier than I feel.

"I did. You see, you witnessed something unfortunate the other night. And I need to know what you plan to do about it."

"I plan to forget about it." I force myself to meet his eyes. "I don't want any trouble. I just want to go back to my life."

"I wish I could believe that." Kane pulls out a gun. "But witnesses are liabilities. And I don't leave liabilities alive."

This is it. The confession. Morrison should be moving in now.

But Kane is faster.

The gun comes up, and I feel Marcus surge forward, taking control. My body moves without my conscious thought, dodging left as the shot rings out. The bullet grazes my shoulder—pain, sharp and bright.

And then Morrison is there, her own gun drawn. "Police! Drop your weapon!"

Kane turns, and for a moment, I think he's going to shoot her. But then he sees the backup—three more officers, all with weapons trained on him.

He drops the gun.

"Victor Kane," Morrison says, "you're under arrest for the murder of James Whitmore."

---

Three months later.

I'm sitting in Dr. Martinez's office, but this time it's a celebration, not a crisis. Kane has been convicted. The case is closed. And I'm still alive.

"How are you feeling?" Dr. Martinez asks.

"Complicated," I admit. "Marcus saved my life. But he also kept secrets from me. From all of us. And I don't know how to feel about that."

"Have you talked to him about it?"

"We're trying. It's... it's a process." I smile slightly. "But we're working on communication. On trust. On being a system instead of just a collection of separate people."

"That's good. That's progress."

"Detective Morrison has been helping too. She understands what it's like. Having DID, I mean. She's been teaching me coping strategies, ways to work with my alters instead of against them."

"And the nightmares?"

"Still there. But getting better." I look out the window at the city beyond. "I saw a murder. Or Marcus did. Or we did. It doesn't matter anymore. What matters is that we survived. That we're learning to live with this."

"You're very brave, Sarah."

"I'm very broken," I correct. "But maybe broken doesn't mean useless. Maybe it just means... complicated."

Dr. Martinez smiles. "I think that's the wisest thing you've ever said."

I leave her office and step out into the sunlight. Somewhere inside me, Marcus is watching. Emma is humming. Claire is making a mental grocery list. The others are there too, a chorus of voices that used to terrify me.

Now they're just... me. All of me. The complicated, broken, surviving me.

I saw a murder.

And I lived to tell about it.

That's enough.
