Paris, 1889

The Exposition Universelle had transformed Paris into a city of wonders, and nowhere was this more evident than at the base of Monsieur Eiffel's tower, where the gaslight illuminated a thousand faces turned upward in awe.

Charlotte Ashford stood among them, her sketchbook clutched to her chest, trying to capture the impossible geometry of iron and ambition that stretched into the twilight sky. She'd come to Paris against her father's wishes, using the small inheritance from her grandmother to fund six months of artistic study. Six months to prove she was more than a proper Boston lady waiting for a suitable marriage.

Six months to become the artist she knew she could be.

"You're holding your pencil wrong."

Charlotte turned sharply, ready to deliver a cutting remark to whatever presumptuous man thought he could critique her work. The words died on her lips.

He was beautiful in the way that French men seemed to be effortlessly beautiful—dark hair that curled slightly at his collar, eyes the color of strong coffee, a mouth that suggested he smiled often and meant it. He wore a worker's clothes, his shirt sleeves rolled up to reveal forearms marked with charcoal and paint.

"I beg your pardon?" Charlotte said in her careful, finishing-school French.

"Your pencil." He gestured at her hand. "You're gripping it like you're afraid it will escape. Art requires a lighter touch. May I?"

Before Charlotte could protest, he'd stepped closer, his hand covering hers, adjusting her grip with fingers that were surprisingly gentle despite their obvious strength.

"Like this," he said softly. "Let the pencil move with your hand, not against it. Art is a conversation, not a battle."

Charlotte's heart was doing something complicated and entirely inappropriate. "And you are an expert on art, Monsieur...?"

"Dubois. Luc Dubois." He released her hand, and Charlotte felt the loss of his warmth like a physical thing. "And yes, I am an artist. Or I try to be. Mostly I paint sets for the theater and take commissions from tourists who want portraits to prove they visited Paris."

"That sounds..." Charlotte searched for a diplomatic word.

"Tedious? Soul-crushing? A waste of whatever talent I might possess?" Luc's smile was self-deprecating. "It is all of those things. But it pays for paint and canvas, and occasionally, it pays for wine. Would you like some wine, Mademoiselle...?"

"Ashford. Charlotte Ashford." She knew she should say no. Knew that proper young ladies didn't accept wine from strange men, especially not strange French men with beautiful eyes and paint-stained hands. "Yes. I would like some wine very much."

They sat at a café near the Trocadéro, drinking cheap red wine and talking about art with the intensity of people who'd been waiting their whole lives for someone who understood.

"Your father doesn't approve of your painting?" Luc asked, refilling her glass.

"My father doesn't approve of anything that doesn't lead directly to marriage and grandchildren." Charlotte took a long sip of wine, feeling pleasantly reckless. "He thinks art is a hobby, not a vocation. Something to occupy my time until I find a suitable husband."

"And have you? Found a suitable husband?"

"I've found several. They're all terribly suitable and terribly boring." Charlotte leaned forward. "Tell me, Monsieur Dubois, why do men assume that women want to be collected like fine china? Displayed on a shelf and admired but never actually used?"

Luc laughed, and the sound was warm and genuine. "I think you're asking the wrong man. I've never wanted to collect anything except experiences and paint colors I can't afford."

"Then we have something in common."

"It seems we do, Mademoiselle Ashford."

They talked until the café closed, and then they walked along the Seine, the gaslight reflecting off the water like scattered stars. Luc told her about growing up in Montmartre, about his mother who'd been a dancer and his father who'd disappeared before he was born. About learning to paint by copying the masters in the Louvre, about dreams of having his work shown in a real gallery someday.

Charlotte told him about Boston, about the suffocating expectations of society, about her grandmother who'd been a painter herself before marriage had ended that dream. About the sketchbooks she'd hidden under her bed as a child, about the first time she'd seen a real painting and felt her soul recognize something it had been searching for.

"You understand," she said as they paused on the Pont des Arts. "Most people don't understand."

"Most people are afraid of understanding," Luc replied. "It's easier to follow the rules than to question why the rules exist."

He was standing very close now, close enough that Charlotte could see the flecks of paint on his collar, could smell the turpentine and tobacco that clung to his clothes. Close enough that when he reached up to tuck a loose strand of hair behind her ear, she felt the touch like electricity.

"I should go," she whispered, not moving.

"You should," Luc agreed, also not moving.

"My landlady will worry."

"Undoubtedly."

"This is improper."

"Extremely."

"I don't even know you."

"Then let me remedy that." Luc's hand cupped her cheek, his thumb tracing her jawline. "I am Luc Dubois. I am twenty-six years old. I am a terrible artist who dreams of being a good one. I drink too much wine and not enough water. I believe that art is the only thing that makes life bearable. And I think you are the most interesting person I've met in Paris, which is saying something, because Paris is full of interesting people."

Charlotte's breath caught. "I am Charlotte Ashford. I am twenty-three years old. I am a good artist who dreams of being a great one. I drink too much tea and not enough wine. I believe that life is the only thing that makes art possible. And I think you are going to break my heart."

"Probably," Luc admitted. "But what a beautiful breaking it will be."

He kissed her then, soft and sweet and tasting of wine and possibility. Charlotte kissed him back, propriety be damned, and felt something in her chest crack open—something that had been locked away for so long she'd forgotten it was there.

Hope.

The affair—for that's what it was, Charlotte couldn't pretend otherwise—lasted through the summer.

They met in secret, in Luc's studio in Montmartre, a cramped room that smelled of paint and ambition. He taught her to see light differently, to understand how shadows gave depth, how color could convey emotion. She taught him about composition, about the mathematics of beauty, about the discipline that turned raw talent into skill.

They painted together, made love on paint-stained sheets, argued about Impressionism versus Realism, and fell deeper into something that neither of them dared to name.

"Come with me," Luc said one evening as they lay tangled together, watching the sunset paint the Paris rooftops in shades of gold and rose. "To the South of France. I have a commission there—a wealthy family wants their villa painted. It will pay enough for us to live for six months. We could paint, really paint, without worrying about money or propriety or what anyone thinks."

Charlotte's heart soared and plummeted in the same moment. "I can't."

"Why not?"

"Because I'm not French. Because I have a return ticket to Boston. Because my father will disown me if I don't come home." She sat up, pulling the sheet around herself. "Because this was always temporary, Luc. We both knew that."

"I didn't know that." Luc's voice was quiet, hurt. "I thought... I thought this meant something."

"It does mean something. It means everything." Charlotte felt tears burning her eyes. "But meaning something doesn't make it possible. I have responsibilities. A family. A life waiting for me in Boston."

"A life you hate."

"A life I'm expected to live." She stood, beginning to dress with shaking hands. "I'm sorry, Luc. I should never have let this go so far. I should never have let myself..."

"Love me?" Luc finished. "Is that what you can't say? That you love me?"

Charlotte's hands stilled on her buttons. "Yes. I love you. And that's exactly why I have to leave."

"That makes no sense."

"It makes perfect sense. If I stay, I lose everything—my family, my inheritance, my reputation. I'll be a scandal, a cautionary tale. And eventually, you'll resent me for it. For giving up everything for you. For making you responsible for my happiness."

"And if you leave?" Luc's voice was raw. "What then?"

"Then I go back to Boston. I marry someone suitable. I paint in secret, in the hours between social obligations. I live the life I was born to live." Charlotte finished dressing, not looking at him. "And I remember this summer as the most beautiful mistake I ever made."

"Charlotte—"

"Don't." She finally met his eyes, and the pain there nearly broke her resolve. "Please don't make this harder than it already is."

She left before he could respond, walking quickly through the narrow streets of Montmartre, her vision blurred with tears. Behind her, she heard Luc call her name once, twice, then silence.

She didn't look back.

Boston, 1890

Charlotte married Thomas Whitmore in the spring, in a ceremony that was everything her father had hoped for—elegant, expensive, and entirely joyless.

Thomas was kind, in his way. He didn't object to her painting, as long as it didn't interfere with her duties as his wife. He gave her a studio in their Beacon Hill townhouse, a room with good light and expensive supplies.

He gave her everything except what she wanted.

She painted dutifully, producing watercolors of flowers and landscapes that were technically perfect and emotionally empty. She attended dinner parties and charity events. She smiled and nodded and played the role of Mrs. Thomas Whitmore with the same skill she'd once applied to capturing light on canvas.

And at night, alone in her studio, she painted from memory—the rooftops of Paris, the gaslight on the Seine, a cramped room in Montmartre where she'd been briefly, impossibly happy.

She painted Luc, over and over, trying to capture the way he'd looked at her, the way his hands had moved when he painted, the way he'd made her feel like art and life were the same thing.

She never showed these paintings to anyone.

The letter arrived on a Tuesday, forwarded through a series of addresses, finally finding her a year after it had been sent.

*Ma chère Charlotte,*

*I am writing to tell you that I am having a show. A real show, in a real gallery in Paris. They are calling me "promising," which is better than "terrible" but not quite "good." I will take it.*

*I wanted you to know because you were part of this. Those months we spent together, you taught me to see differently. To paint with discipline as well as passion. To believe that I could be more than a starving artist in Montmartre.*

*I have painted you, Charlotte. Many times. I cannot seem to stop. The gallery owner says they are my best work. She wants to feature them prominently in the show.*

*I told her no.*

*Not because they aren't good—they are. But because they are private. They are mine. They are the record of a summer when I was happier than I knew how to be.*

*I hope you are well. I hope you are painting. I hope that sometimes, when the light is right, you remember Paris.*

*I hope you remember me.*

*Toujours,*
*Luc*

Charlotte read the letter three times, her hands shaking. Then she locked herself in her studio and painted until dawn—not flowers or landscapes, but memory and longing and the ghost of a love she'd walked away from.

When Thomas found her in the morning, surrounded by canvases of Paris, he didn't say anything. He just looked at the paintings, at his wife's tear-stained face, and quietly closed the door.

That evening, he came to her studio with a telegram form.

"I think," he said carefully, "that you should send your congratulations to Monsieur Dubois. It would be the polite thing to do."

Charlotte looked at her husband—kind, boring Thomas, who'd given her everything except passion—and saw understanding in his eyes.

"Thank you," she whispered.

Thomas nodded and left her alone with the telegram form and a decision that would change everything.

She picked up her pen and began to write.

Paris, 1891

Charlotte stepped off the train at Gare du Nord with a single trunk and a heart full of terror and hope.

She'd left Thomas. Left Boston. Left everything she was supposed to be.

She'd used her grandmother's inheritance—the last of it—to buy passage to Paris and six months of living expenses. After that, she'd have to support herself with her art or starve trying.

She was terrified.

She was free.

Luc was waiting at the station, just as her telegram had asked. He looked older, more successful—his clothes were better, his bearing more confident. But his eyes were the same, and when he saw her, his face transformed with a joy so pure it made her chest ache.

"You came," he said, as if he couldn't quite believe it.

"I came," Charlotte confirmed. "I'm sorry it took so long. I'm sorry I was afraid. I'm sorry—"

Luc kissed her, there in the middle of the station, with a hundred strangers watching. He kissed her like she was air and he'd been drowning, like she was home and he'd been lost.

"Don't apologize," he said when they finally broke apart. "You're here now. That's all that matters."

"I have no money. No prospects. No idea how to support myself."

"Then we'll figure it out together." Luc took her hand, lacing their fingers together. "I have a studio. It's bigger than the old one. Room for two artists. And the gallery owner who wanted to show my paintings of you? She wants to meet you. She thinks you have talent."

"How does she know? She's never seen my work."

"I showed her. The paintings you sent with your telegram." Luc smiled. "The ones of Paris. Of us. Charlotte, they're extraordinary. Raw and honest and full of feeling. Everything your proper Boston watercolors weren't."

Charlotte felt something loosen in her chest—the last knot of fear and doubt finally unraveling.

"So what happens now?" she asked.

"Now?" Luc picked up her trunk with one hand, keeping her hand clasped in his other. "Now we paint. We live. We make art that matters. We make a life that matters."

"Together?"

"Together."

They walked out of the station into the Paris afternoon, into gaslight and possibility and a future they would create with their own hands.

It wouldn't be easy. Charlotte knew that. There would be scandal and struggle and moments when she questioned her choice.

But there would also be art. And love. And the freedom to be exactly who she was meant to be.

And in the end, that was worth everything.
