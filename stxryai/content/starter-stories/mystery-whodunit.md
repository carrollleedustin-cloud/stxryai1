The storm hit at midnight, and by morning, one of them was dead.

Detective Inspector Sarah Blackwood stood in the lighthouse keeper's quarters, looking down at the body of Marcus Ashford. He lay sprawled on the floor, a wine glass shattered beside him, his face frozen in an expression of surprise. The room smelled of salt air, old wood, and something bitter she couldn't quite identify.

"Poison," Dr. Patel confirmed, kneeling beside the body. "Cyanide, if I had to guess. Fast-acting. He would have died within minutes."

Sarah looked around the room. Ten people had come to Beacon Point Lighthouse for the weekend—a reunion of sorts, celebrating the twentieth anniversary of their graduation from Oxford. Now they were trapped here by the storm, the causeway to the mainland submerged under fifteen feet of angry ocean, and one of them was a murderer.

"Everyone's in the common room," Constable Davies said from the doorway. He was young, barely twenty-five, and this was his first murder investigation. He looked like he might be sick. "They're... not taking it well."

"I imagine not," Sarah said dryly. She took one last look at Marcus Ashford—successful banker, married father of two, by all accounts a decent man—and wondered which of his old friends had wanted him dead badly enough to poison him.

---

The common room was tense with barely suppressed panic.

Sarah studied the nine remaining guests as she entered. They sat in clusters, some crying, some staring into space, all of them looking like they'd rather be anywhere else.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Sarah began, her voice cutting through the murmurs. "I'm Detective Inspector Blackwood. I know you're all frightened and want to leave, but I'm afraid that's impossible until the storm passes. Which means we're all stuck here together. With a murderer."

The room erupted in protests and denials.

"This is absurd," said Victoria Chen, a corporate lawyer with perfectly styled hair that hadn't moved despite the storm. "Marcus was our friend. None of us would hurt him."

"And yet someone did," Sarah replied calmly. "So let's start with the basics. Who was the last person to see Marcus alive?"

Silence.

Then, hesitantly, a woman with red hair and paint-stained fingers raised her hand. "I was. I think. I saw him go to his room around eleven. He said he was tired."

"And you are?"

"Emma Hartley. I'm an artist. Was an artist. Am an artist." She laughed nervously. "Sorry, I'm not good with dead bodies."

"Few people are," Sarah said kindly. "Did Marcus seem upset? Worried?"

"No, he seemed... normal. Maybe a bit drunk. We'd all been drinking." Emma gestured at the empty wine bottles scattered around the room. "It was supposed to be a celebration."

Sarah made a note. "Who else was still awake at eleven?"

Slowly, hands went up. Victoria. A man who introduced himself as James Park, a professor. Another man, David Walsh, who owned a tech startup. And twins—Oliver and Olivia Blackwood (no relation to Sarah)—who ran a successful restaurant in London.

"So six of you were awake when Marcus went to his room," Sarah said. "What about the rest of you?"

"I went to bed at ten," said an older woman with silver hair. "I'm Margaret Ashford. Marcus's aunt. I raised him after his parents died." Her voice was steady, but her hands shook as she clutched a handkerchief.

"I was in bed by nine-thirty," added a nervous-looking man. "Thomas Greene. I'm a librarian. I don't do well with late nights."

The last person, a woman in her forties with kind eyes, spoke up. "I was reading in my room. I'm Dr. Rachel Morrison. I'm a psychiatrist. I heard people moving around, but I didn't come out."

Sarah nodded, filing away the information. "Here's what we know: Marcus died between eleven PM and midnight. The poison was in his wine. Which means someone put it there. Someone in this room."

"But we all drank from the same bottles," James protested. "How could someone poison just Marcus's glass?"

"That," Sarah said, "is an excellent question."

Sarah spent the next hour interviewing each guest separately in the lighthouse keeper's office.

Victoria Chen was first. She sat with perfect posture, her lawyer's mask firmly in place.

"Marcus and I dated at Oxford," she admitted. "It ended badly. He cheated on me with Emma." She said it matter-of-factly, but Sarah caught the flash of old pain in her eyes. "But that was twenty years ago. I'm married now. Happy. I didn't kill him over ancient history."

"Did you see him put anything in his wine?"

"No. We were all drinking together. Laughing about old times. It was..." Victoria's composure cracked slightly. "It was nice. Until it wasn't."

Emma Hartley was next, and she was crying before Sarah even asked a question.

"I know what Victoria told you," she sobbed. "About Marcus and me. It's true. We had an affair. But I loved him. I've loved him for twenty years. I would never hurt him."

"Were you still in contact?"

Emma hesitated. "Sometimes. He'd call when he was in London. We'd meet for coffee. Just as friends. His wife didn't know."

"Did anyone else know?"

"I don't think so. We were careful."

Sarah made a note. A secret affair. A motive for Victoria, perhaps. Or for Marcus's wife, if she'd found out. But Marcus's wife wasn't here.

James Park was calm, academic. "Marcus and I were roommates at Oxford. Best friends, really. Or we were, until the incident."

"What incident?"

"Marcus plagiarized my thesis. Got me expelled. I spent two years fighting to clear my name." James's voice was bitter. "By the time I did, he'd graduated with honors, gotten a job at a prestigious bank. My career never recovered. I ended up teaching at a community college."

"That sounds like a strong motive for murder."

"It would be, if I were the vengeful type. But I'm not. I forgave Marcus years ago. Mostly." James smiled sadly. "Besides, if I wanted him dead, I wouldn't have waited twenty years."

David Walsh was nervous, fidgety. "I owed Marcus money. A lot of money. He invested in my startup five years ago. The company failed. I couldn't pay him back."

"How much money?"

"Two million pounds."

Sarah's eyebrows rose. "That's a significant sum."

"He was going to sue me. Take everything I had left. My house, my car, my reputation." David's hands shook. "But I didn't kill him. I was trying to negotiate a payment plan. He was actually being reasonable about it."

The twins, Oliver and Olivia, were interviewed together at their insistence.

"We barely knew Marcus," Oliver said. "We were in different social circles at Oxford."

"Then why come to the reunion?"

Olivia and Oliver exchanged glances. "Emma invited us. She's our cousin. We came to support her."

"Did you know about her relationship with Marcus?"

"Everyone knew," Olivia said. "Emma's not subtle. We thought it was sad, honestly. Her pining after a married man for twenty years."

Margaret Ashford was composed, dignified in her grief. "Marcus was like a son to me. I loved him. I would never harm him."

"Did he have any enemies?"

"In his line of work? Probably. Banking makes people rich and makes people angry. But none of those people are here."

Thomas Greene was exactly what he appeared to be—a nervous librarian who seemed genuinely shocked by the murder.

"I didn't even want to come," he admitted. "I only knew Marcus tangentially. But Emma insisted. She said it would be good for me to socialize more."

Dr. Rachel Morrison was the last interview, and she was observant in the way only a psychiatrist could be.

"You want to know what I think?" she said. "I think everyone here had a reason to hate Marcus. Victoria for the cheating. Emma for the unrequited love. James for the plagiarism. David for the debt. Even Margaret—did you know Marcus was planning to sell the family estate? The one Margaret grew up in? She was devastated."

"And you?" Sarah asked. "What was your reason?"

Rachel smiled sadly. "Marcus and I were engaged once. Before Victoria, before Emma. He broke it off three days before the wedding. Said he wasn't ready for commitment. Then he married someone else six months later." She paused. "But I didn't kill him, Inspector. I'm a healer, not a murderer."

Sarah stood in the lighthouse tower, looking out at the storm-tossed sea, piecing together the puzzle.

Everyone had a motive. Everyone had opportunity. But only one person had means.

She thought about the wine. About the poison. About the timing.

And suddenly, she knew.

---

Sarah gathered everyone in the common room one last time.

"I know who killed Marcus Ashford," she announced.

The room went silent.

"The key was the wine," Sarah continued. "Everyone drank from the same bottles, but only Marcus was poisoned. Which means the poison wasn't in the bottle. It was in the glass. Someone poisoned Marcus's specific glass."

"But we all used the same glasses," Victoria protested. "They were from the lighthouse's kitchen."

"Exactly. Which means the killer needed to know which glass Marcus would use. They needed to mark it somehow." Sarah turned to Emma. "You're an artist. You brought supplies with you. Including paint."

Emma's face went white.

"You painted a tiny mark on one glass. Barely visible. Just enough that you'd know which one to give Marcus. You poured his wine. You handed him the poisoned glass. And you were the last person to see him alive because you followed him to his room to make sure the poison worked."

"No," Emma whispered. "No, I loved him."

"You did love him. For twenty years. And three days ago, you found out he was ending your affair. He'd decided to recommit to his marriage. To cut you out of his life completely." Sarah's voice was gentle but firm. "You couldn't bear it. If you couldn't have him, no one could."

Emma collapsed, sobbing. "He said it meant nothing. That I meant nothing. After twenty years, I was nothing to him." She looked up, her face streaked with tears and rage. "He deserved it. He used me. He used all of us. Victoria, James, David—he hurt everyone he touched. I just made sure he couldn't hurt anyone else."

Constable Davies moved forward with handcuffs, and Emma didn't resist.

---

The storm broke at dawn, and by noon, the causeway was passable. Emma was taken into custody. The others left quickly, eager to escape the lighthouse and its memories.

Sarah stood on the shore, watching the waves, thinking about love and hate and the thin line between them.

"Good work, Inspector," Dr. Patel said beside her.

"Was it?" Sarah asked. "A woman loved a man so much it destroyed her. And now she'll spend the rest of her life in prison."

"She killed someone."

"I know. But I can't help thinking... if Marcus had just been honest with her twenty years ago, if he'd let her go instead of stringing her along, maybe none of this would have happened."

"Maybe," Dr. Patel agreed. "But we can't change the past. We can only solve the mysteries it leaves behind."

Sarah nodded, taking one last look at Beacon Point Lighthouse, standing sentinel against the sea.

Another mystery solved. Another murderer caught.

But the questions remained: What drives someone to kill? And could any of us, pushed far enough, do the same?

Sarah didn't have answers. She only had evidence, logic, and the cold comfort of justice served.

It would have to be enough.
