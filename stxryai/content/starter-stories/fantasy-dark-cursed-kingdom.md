The king was dying, and everyone in the palace was pretending not to notice.

Lady Morrigan Blackthorn watched from the shadows of the throne room's upper gallery as her uncle, King Aldric the Merciful, coughed blood into a silk handkerchief. The courtiers below continued their elaborate dance of flattery and deception, their voices echoing off the vaulted ceiling like the chittering of carrion birds.

Merciful. What a joke. Aldric had earned that title by executing his enemies with poison instead of the axe—a slower death, but one that left the body intact for a proper funeral. So merciful.

Morrigan's fingers traced the iron railing, feeling the cold metal beneath her gloves. The palace of Ravencrest had been built on bones—literally. The foundations were constructed from the remains of the old dynasty, ground to powder and mixed with mortar. Some nights, when the wind howled through the corridors, Morrigan swore she could hear them screaming.

"You shouldn't be up here."

She didn't turn at the voice. She'd known he would find her. Cassian always did.

"Neither should you, Lord Commander." Morrigan kept her eyes on the throne room below, where her uncle was now being helped to his feet by his attendants. "Shouldn't you be down there, protecting your king?"

"My king is beyond protection." Cassian moved to stand beside her, his armor making soft clicking sounds with each movement. "The curse has him now. It's only a matter of time."

The curse. Everyone knew about it, though no one dared speak its name aloud. Fifty years ago, King Aldric's father had betrayed the Witch Queen of the Thornwood, breaking a sacred pact. She'd cursed the royal bloodline in return—every king would die before his time, consumed from within by a rot that no healer could cure. Aldric's father had lasted three years. Aldric himself had ruled for seven.

Morrigan was next in line for the throne.

She was twenty-three years old, and the curse was already whispering in her veins.

"How long does he have?" she asked quietly.

"Days. Maybe hours." Cassian's voice was carefully neutral, but Morrigan could hear the weight beneath it. He'd served her uncle faithfully for a decade, and before that, her grandfather. Loyalty was Cassian's curse, as surely as rot was hers. "The council is already preparing for the succession."

"Of course they are." Morrigan's laugh was bitter. "Like vultures circling a dying horse."

Below, the throne room was emptying. The courtiers filed out in their elaborate gowns and doublets, whispering behind jeweled fans and gloved hands. Plotting. Always plotting. Half of them wanted her on the throne because they thought they could control her. The other half wanted her dead because they knew they couldn't.

"There's another way," Cassian said carefully.

Morrigan finally turned to look at him. Cassian was ten years her senior, his face scarred from a dozen battles, his dark hair shot through with premature gray. He'd been her sword instructor when she was a child, her protector when she grew older, and something more complicated in the years since. Something neither of them had dared to name.

"What way?" she asked, though she already knew. There was only one way to break a curse this powerful.

"Find the Witch Queen. Negotiate a new pact."

"My grandfather tried that. She turned him into a tree. He's still standing in the Thornwood, screaming silently while the birds nest in his branches."

"Your grandfather tried to kill her," Cassian corrected. "You're smarter than that."

"Am I?" Morrigan looked down at her hands. Even through the gloves, she could feel it—the faint tingling that meant the curse was waking up, taking notice of her proximity to the throne. "Or am I just more desperate?"

A commotion below drew their attention. The king had collapsed, his attendants rushing to his side. Blood pooled on the marble floor, black as ink in the torchlight.

"You're out of time," Cassian said softly. "Make your choice, Morrigan. Die slowly on that throne, or risk everything to break the curse."

Morrigan watched her uncle being carried from the throne room, leaving a trail of blood behind him. The Poison Crown, they called it. The throne that killed everyone who sat upon it.

She'd spent her whole life preparing to wear it.

Maybe it was time to destroy it instead.

The Thornwood began where civilization ended.

Morrigan stood at the forest's edge, staring into the darkness between the trees. No birds sang here. No animals moved in the underbrush. The Thornwood was a place of old magic, the kind that predated kingdoms and kings, that remembered when humans were prey and the world belonged to things with too many teeth.

"Last chance to turn back," Cassian said beside her. He'd insisted on coming, despite her protests. Loyal to the end, even if that end was in a cursed forest.

"If I turn back, I die," Morrigan said simply. "If I go forward, I might die. I'll take 'might' over 'certainly.'"

She stepped into the forest, and the world changed.

The air grew thick and heavy, pressing against her skin like a physical weight. The trees here were ancient, their trunks wider than houses, their branches forming a canopy so dense that no sunlight penetrated. Bioluminescent fungi grew in spirals up the bark, casting everything in a sickly green glow.

And the trees were watching her.

Morrigan could feel their attention, ancient and alien and hungry. These weren't the friendly trees from children's stories. These were the trees that ate children, that drank blood from their roots, that whispered madness to anyone foolish enough to listen.

"Stay close," she murmured to Cassian, though she knew it wouldn't matter. If the Witch Queen wanted them dead, they'd be dead. If she wanted them alive, they'd reach her sanctum.

If she wanted them to suffer, well. The Thornwood had a thousand ways to make that happen.

They walked for hours, or maybe minutes—time moved strangely here. Morrigan saw things in the shadows between the trees: faces that weren't quite human, eyes that glowed with foxfire, shapes that moved on too many legs. Once, she heard her mother's voice calling her name, though her mother had been dead for fifteen years.

Cassian heard it too. She could tell by the way his hand tightened on his sword hilt, by the way his jaw clenched. But he didn't speak, and neither did she. Words had power in places like this. Better to stay silent.

Finally, they reached a clearing.

The Witch Queen's sanctum was not what Morrigan had expected. No dark tower, no circle of standing stones, no altar of bones. Just a cottage, small and neat, with smoke rising from its chimney and herbs hanging from the eaves to dry.

It was somehow more terrifying than any nightmare palace could have been.

"Enter," a voice called from within. Not old and crone-like, as the stories suggested, but young and clear and amused. "I've been expecting you, little princess."

Morrigan exchanged a glance with Cassian, then pushed open the door.

The Witch Queen sat at a spinning wheel, her fingers moving with practiced ease as she drew thread from a spindle. She was beautiful—heartbreakingly so—with silver hair that fell to her waist and eyes the color of storm clouds. She wore a simple dress of homespun wool, and her feet were bare.

She looked no older than Morrigan herself.

"You're surprised," the Witch Queen said, not looking up from her spinning. "You expected a monster. But monsters are made, little princess, not born. Your grandfather made me into this." She gestured at the cottage, at the forest beyond. "He took everything from me—my family, my home, my humanity. And then he was surprised when I took something back."

"The curse," Morrigan said, finding her voice.

"The curse." The Witch Queen's smile was sharp as broken glass. "Yes. My masterwork. Fifty years of suffering, distilled into a single hex. Every king of Ravencrest will die screaming, their bodies rotting from the inside out, until the bloodline ends or the debt is paid."

"What debt?" Cassian demanded. His hand was on his sword, though they both knew it would be useless here. "What did the old king take from you that's worth fifty years of death?"

The Witch Queen finally looked up, and her eyes were full of old pain and older rage.

"He took my daughter," she said softly. "She was seven years old. He had her burned alive in the town square, called her a witch's spawn, said her death would protect the kingdom from dark magic." Her fingers never stopped spinning, the thread growing longer and longer. "So I cursed his bloodline. Every king will die as my daughter died—consumed by fire from within, burning and burning and never quite dying until the very end."

The room was silent except for the soft whir of the spinning wheel.

Morrigan felt something crack open inside her chest. She'd known her grandfather was cruel—everyone knew that. But this. This was monstrous.

"I'm sorry," she said, and meant it.

The Witch Queen laughed, but there was no humor in it. "Sorry. How quaint. Your grandfather never apologized. Your uncle never apologized. They just died, screaming, and I listened to every moment of it." She stood, leaving the spinning wheel to turn on its own. "And now you've come to beg for mercy. To ask me to lift the curse so you can sit on your throne of bones and rule over the kingdom built on my daughter's ashes."

"No," Morrigan said.

The Witch Queen paused. "No?"

"I didn't come to beg for mercy." Morrigan straightened her spine, meeting those storm-cloud eyes without flinching. "I came to offer justice."

"Justice." The word hung in the air like a blade. "Explain."

"The throne is cursed. The kingdom is rotting from within, just like its kings. The people suffer while the nobles play their games of power, and nothing ever changes because everyone's too busy trying to survive to actually fix anything." Morrigan took a step forward. "I don't want to rule that kingdom. I want to burn it down and build something better from the ashes."

Cassian made a strangled sound beside her, but Morrigan ignored him. She was committed now.

"I'll give you what you want," she continued. "The bloodline ends with me. I'll take no husband, bear no children. When I die, the Poison Crown dies with me. But in return, you lift the curse long enough for me to dismantle the old kingdom. To give the power back to the people. To make sure that what happened to your daughter never happens to anyone else's child."

The Witch Queen stared at her for a long moment. Then she began to laugh—really laugh, deep and genuine and slightly unhinged.

"Oh, little princess," she said when she could breathe again. "You're either the bravest person I've ever met or the most foolish. Possibly both." She circled Morrigan like a predator, studying her from every angle. "You'd really do it? Destroy everything your family built? Become the last of your line?"

"Yes," Morrigan said without hesitation.

"Even knowing that the nobles will fight you? That half the kingdom will call you traitor? That you'll die alone and unmourned, with no legacy but ashes?"

"Yes."

The Witch Queen stopped in front of her, so close that Morrigan could see the silver flecks in her eyes, could smell the herbs and woodsmoke that clung to her skin.

"Then we have a deal," she said, and held out her hand.

Morrigan took it, and felt power surge through her—not the rot of the curse, but something cleaner, sharper. A bargain sealed in blood and magic and the promise of revolution.

"Ten years," the Witch Queen said. "I'll give you ten years free of the curse. Ten years to tear down the old kingdom and build your new one. But when those ten years are up, the curse returns, and you die. No extensions. No second chances. Ten years, and then the debt is paid in full."

"Agreed," Morrigan said.

The Witch Queen smiled, and for the first time, it reached her eyes. "Then go, last queen of Ravencrest. Go and burn it all down. I'll be watching."

---

They emerged from the Thornwood at dawn, the forest releasing them as suddenly as it had claimed them. Cassian was silent as they walked back toward the palace, his face unreadable.

Finally, he spoke. "Ten years."

"Ten years," Morrigan agreed.

"And then you die."

"And then I die." She looked at him, at this man who'd followed her into a cursed forest, who'd stood beside her while she bargained away her life. "I'm sorry, Cassian. I know this isn't what you wanted."

"What I wanted," Cassian said slowly, "was for you to live. But if you're going to die anyway, then I suppose dying for something is better than dying for nothing." He stopped walking and turned to face her fully. "Ten years to change the world. Let's make them count."

Morrigan felt something warm bloom in her chest—hope, maybe, or something like it. "You'll help me?"

"Always," Cassian said simply. "Until the very end."

They walked back to Ravencrest together, as the sun rose over the cursed kingdom. King Aldric died that afternoon, blood and rot and screaming, just as the curse demanded.

Lady Morrigan Blackthorn was crowned queen at sunset.

She wore the Poison Crown for exactly ten minutes before she took it off, walked to the throne room's balcony, and threw it into the crowd below.

"The age of kings is over," she announced to the shocked masses. "Let the age of the people begin."

The revolution started that night.

The Witch Queen, watching from her cottage in the Thornwood, smiled.

Morrigan's choice to end the bloodline and dismantle the monarchy offers a fresh take on the chosen one narrative.
