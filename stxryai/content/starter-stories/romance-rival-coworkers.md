Jordan Hayes had exactly three rules for surviving corporate life:

1. Never date a coworker
2. Never let them see you sweat
3. Never, under any circumstances, lose to Alex Chen

The first two were negotiable. The third was sacred.

"Morning, Hayes." Alex's voice was smooth as expensive whiskey as he slid into the chair across from her in the conference room. He was wearing that charcoal suit again, the one that made his shoulders look unfairly good, and his smile was the kind that made people either want to kiss him or punch him.

Jordan wanted to do both, which was becoming a problem.

"Chen." She didn't look up from her tablet, where she was making final adjustments to her presentation. The promotion to Creative Director was coming down to the two of them—it always came down to the two of them—and this pitch would decide everything.

"Nervous?" Alex asked, and Jordan could hear the smirk in his voice.

"Terrified," she deadpanned. "I'm thinking of faking a medical emergency. Maybe appendicitis. Do you think they'd reschedule?"

"Probably not. But I'd visit you in the hospital. Bring flowers. Gloat tastefully."

Jordan finally looked up, meeting those dark eyes that always seemed to see too much. "Your concern is touching."

"I'm a giver." Alex leaned back in his chair, all casual confidence. "So, what's your angle? Emotional storytelling? Data-driven insights? Interpretive dance?"

"If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise."

"Fair enough." He was quiet for a moment, and something shifted in his expression—something almost genuine beneath the competitive banter. "For what it's worth, I hope you nail it. The pitch, I mean. Not the appendicitis."

Jordan felt something warm and uncomfortable flutter in her chest. She crushed it immediately. "Save the mind games for the boardroom, Chen."

"Who says I'm playing games?"

Before Jordan could respond, their boss, Margaret Chen—no relation to Alex, though they shared the same terrifying competence—entered the room with the rest of the executive team.

Game time.

Jordan's presentation was flawless.

She'd spent three weeks perfecting every slide, every transition, every carefully crafted sentence. Her campaign concept for their biggest client—a sustainable fashion brand trying to break into the mainstream market—was bold, innovative, and exactly what the company needed.

The executives nodded. Took notes. Asked thoughtful questions that Jordan answered with practiced ease.

When she finished, Margaret smiled. "Excellent work, Jordan. Truly impressive."

Jordan allowed herself a small moment of triumph as she returned to her seat. She'd nailed it. The promotion was hers.

Then Alex stood up, and Jordan's confidence wavered.

Because Alex Chen didn't just present. He performed.

He started with a story—a personal anecdote about his grandmother, who'd been a seamstress in Hong Kong, who'd taught him that clothes weren't just fabric but identity, heritage, transformation. He wove that story into the client's brand narrative so seamlessly that by the time he revealed his campaign concept, everyone in the room was leaning forward, captivated.

His idea was different from Jordan's. Where hers was bold and disruptive, his was intimate and emotional. Where hers spoke to the mind, his spoke to the heart.

It was brilliant.

Jordan hated how brilliant it was.

When Alex finished, the room was silent for a beat too long. Then Margaret started clapping, and everyone joined in.

"Both presentations were exceptional," Margaret said, and Jordan's stomach sank because she knew what was coming. "We need some time to deliberate. We'll have a decision by end of day."

Jordan was stress-eating Thai food in her office when Alex knocked on her door frame.

"Go away," she said around a mouthful of pad thai. "I'm wallowing."

"Can I wallow with you?" Alex held up a bag from her favorite bakery. "I brought reinforcements."

Jordan eyed the bag suspiciously. "Is this a peace offering or psychological warfare?"

"Can't it be both?" Alex entered without waiting for permission, setting the bag on her desk. Inside were two slices of chocolate cake—the good kind, with the ganache frosting that cost too much but tasted like happiness.

"You're trying to make me fat so I'll be too sluggish to compete," Jordan accused, but she was already reaching for a fork.

"You caught me. My master plan." Alex settled into the chair across from her, taking his own slice. "How are you holding up?"

"I'm fine."

"Liar."

Jordan stabbed her cake with more force than necessary. "Your presentation was good."

"Yours was better."

She looked up sharply. "Don't patronize me, Chen."

"I'm not." Alex's expression was serious now, the competitive mask dropped. "Your concept was stronger. More innovative. More on-brand. If they choose mine, it'll be because it's safer, not because it's better."

Jordan didn't know what to do with that. With Alex being genuine instead of cocky. It was disorienting.

"Why are you here?" she asked quietly. "We're competing for the same job. You should be in your office, practicing your victory speech."

"Because you looked sad," Alex said simply. "And I don't like it when you're sad."

"We're rivals."

"We're also friends. Aren't we?"

Were they? Jordan thought about the past three years of working together. The late nights finishing projects. The inside jokes. The way Alex always remembered how she took her coffee. The way she always knew when he was stressed because he'd run his hand through his hair exactly three times.

"I don't know," she admitted. "Are we?"

Alex was quiet for a moment, studying her with an intensity that made her want to look away. "What if I want to be more than friends?"

Jordan's fork clattered to her desk. "What?"

"You heard me."

"Alex, we're competing for a promotion. This is literally the worst possible timing—"

"There's never going to be a good time," Alex interrupted. "There's always going to be another project, another competition, another reason to keep pretending we're just rivals who happen to work well together." He leaned forward. "But I'm tired of pretending, Jordan. I'm tired of turning everything into a competition because it's easier than admitting I have feelings for you."

Jordan's heart was doing something complicated and inconvenient in her chest. "You have feelings for me?"

"Embarrassingly strong ones. It's very inconvenient."

"How long?"

"Remember the Henderson pitch? Two years ago?"

Jordan remembered. They'd been partnered together for the first time, forced to collaborate instead of compete. They'd fought for three days straight, then stayed up all night finishing the presentation, fueled by coffee and creative adrenaline. They'd won the account. And when Alex had high-fived her in celebration, something had shifted.

"Two years?" Jordan's voice came out smaller than she intended. "You've had feelings for me for two years and you never said anything?"

"You're terrifying when you're competitive. I was afraid you'd destroy me."

"I still might."

"I'm counting on it." Alex's smile was soft now, vulnerable in a way she'd never seen. "Look, I know this is complicated. I know we're competing for the same job, and one of us is going to be disappointed. But I also know that I don't want to spend another two years pretending I don't care about you. So I'm saying it now, terrible timing and all: I like you, Jordan Hayes. I like your brain and your ambition and the way you eat Thai food when you're stressed. I like competing with you, but I'd also like to try not competing with you. Just to see what happens."

Jordan's mind was racing. This was Alex Chen. Her rival. Her nemesis. The person who'd made her work harder, think smarter, be better for three years.

The person who remembered her coffee order. Who brought her cake when she was sad. Who looked at her like she was the most interesting person in the room.

"I have rules," she said finally.

"I know. Never date a coworker."

"That's rule number one."

"Rules are meant to be broken."

"Not my rules."

Alex stood, and for a moment Jordan thought he was leaving. Instead, he walked around her desk, stopping close enough that she had to tilt her head back to look at him.

"Then make a new rule," he said softly. "Make a rule that says it's okay to take a chance on something that scares you. Make a rule that says you're allowed to want something besides the next promotion. Make a rule that says Jordan Hayes is allowed to be happy."

"I am happy," Jordan protested weakly.

"Are you?" Alex's hand came up, hovering near her face but not quite touching. "Because from where I'm standing, you look like someone who's been running so hard for so long that you've forgotten why you started running in the first place."

Jordan felt something crack open inside her chest—something she'd been keeping carefully locked away. "What if we try this and it doesn't work? What if we ruin everything?"

"What if we try this and it does work?" Alex countered. "What if we're even better together than we are competing?"

"That's a big what if."

"I'm willing to risk it if you are."

Jordan looked up at him—at Alex Chen, her rival, her friend, her maybe-something-more—and made a decision that terrified her more than any presentation ever had.

"Okay," she whispered.

"Okay?"

"Okay, let's try. But if this goes badly, I'm blaming you."

Alex's smile was bright enough to light up the whole office. "I can live with that."

He leaned down, and Jordan met him halfway, and when their lips touched it felt like winning and losing and something entirely new all at once.

Her phone buzzed. They broke apart, and Jordan grabbed it with shaking hands.

It was an email from Margaret.

*Please come to my office. Both of you.*

---

They walked to Margaret's office together, not quite touching but close enough that Jordan could feel the warmth of Alex's presence beside her.

Margaret was waiting, her expression unreadable.

"I've made my decision about the Creative Director position," she said without preamble. "And I have to say, it was one of the hardest decisions I've ever made. You're both exceptional candidates."

Jordan's hand found Alex's, their fingers intertwining.

"However," Margaret continued, "I've decided to go in a different direction entirely." She paused, and something that might have been amusement flickered across her face. "I'm creating two Creative Director positions. One focused on brand strategy and innovation—that's you, Jordan. And one focused on narrative and emotional engagement—that's you, Alex."

Jordan blinked. "Two positions?"

"You're better together than you are competing," Margaret said, echoing Alex's earlier words. "Your presentations proved that. Jordan's concept was brilliant but needed heart. Alex's concept was moving but needed structure. Imagine what you could create if you actually collaborated instead of trying to outdo each other."

"You want us to work together?" Alex asked.

"I want you to lead together. Co-Creative Directors. Equal authority, equal responsibility, equal pay." Margaret's smile was knowing. "Unless you think you can't handle it?"

Jordan looked at Alex. Alex looked at Jordan.

"We can handle it," they said in unison.

"Good. You start Monday. Now get out of my office. And Hayes? Chen? Whatever's happening between you two, keep it professional in the workplace. But also—" Margaret's expression softened. "Be happy. Life's too short to spend it competing with the person you care about."

They made it to the elevator before Alex started laughing.

"We both won," he said, pulling Jordan close. "How is that possible?"

"I don't know," Jordan admitted, wrapping her arms around his waist. "But I'm not complaining."

"So, about those rules of yours..."

"I'm making new ones."

"Yeah? What's rule number one?"

Jordan smiled against his chest. "Rule number one: Alex Chen is allowed to take me to dinner. Somewhere nice. Somewhere that's not the office cafeteria."

"I can work with that. What's rule number two?"

"Rule number two: We're partners now. In work and... whatever this is. Which means no more competing."

"No more competing?" Alex pulled back to look at her, mock horror on his face. "But competing with you is my favorite thing."

"Fine. We can still compete. But only about stupid things. Like who can make the better coffee. Or who's better at Mario Kart."

"I'm definitely better at Mario Kart."

"We'll see about that."

Alex kissed her again, soft and sweet and full of promise. "I'm really glad you broke your rules."

"I'm really glad you made me," Jordan admitted.

The elevator dinged, and they stepped out into the lobby, into the evening light, into whatever came next.

Together.
