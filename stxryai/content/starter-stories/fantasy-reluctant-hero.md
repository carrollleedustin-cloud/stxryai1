The sheep knew before Kael did.

They scattered across the hillside at dawn, bleating in panic, their hooves churning the frost-covered grass into muddy chaos. Kael dropped his staff and ran after them, cursing under his breath. Three years he'd been tending Master Orin's flock, and never once had they bolted like this—not for wolves, not for storms, not for anything.

Then he saw what they were running from.

The stone circle at the hill's crest was glowing. Not the warm orange of sunrise, but a sickly green that pulsed like a heartbeat, casting writhing shadows across the ancient monoliths. Kael's breath caught in his throat. The Shepherd's Stones had stood silent for a thousand years, remnants of the Old Kingdom that even the village elders spoke of only in whispers.

"No, no, no." Kael backed away, his worn boots slipping on the dew-slick grass. "Not me. Anyone but me."

But the light intensified, and a sound like distant thunder rolled across the valley. The sheep had vanished over the far ridge. Smart animals. Kael should have followed them.

Instead, his feet carried him forward.

He'd heard the stories, of course. Every child in Thornhaven had. The Shepherd's Stones were a test, a calling, a curse—depending on which drunk farmer you asked at the tavern. When the stones awakened, they chose a champion. Someone to bear the weight of ancient magic and face whatever darkness threatened the realm.

The last time they'd glowed was three hundred years ago, during the Plague of Shadows. The chosen hero, a blacksmith's daughter named Sera, had saved the kingdom. She'd also died screaming, her body consumed by the very magic she'd wielded.

Kael was seventeen years old. He'd never held a sword. He could barely read. His greatest accomplishment was keeping Master Orin's sheep alive through last winter's harsh snows.

He was nobody.

The green light enveloped him like cold water, and the world disappeared.

When Kael opened his eyes, he was standing in a place that shouldn't exist.

The sky was the color of old bruises, purple and black and shot through with veins of silver lightning that never quite struck the ground. The earth beneath his feet was glass—or something like glass—smooth and dark and reflecting a starfield that wasn't above him. He could see himself in it, distorted and strange, as if he were looking up from the bottom of a deep well.

"Welcome, Shepherd."

Kael spun around. The voice had come from everywhere and nowhere, resonant and ancient, like stones grinding together in the deep places of the earth.

A figure materialized before him. It was tall—impossibly tall—and wore robes that seemed woven from smoke and starlight. Its face was hidden beneath a hood, but Kael could feel its gaze like a physical weight pressing against his chest.

"I'm not—" Kael's voice cracked. He cleared his throat and tried again. "I'm not a shepherd. I mean, I am, but not the kind you're looking for. I just watch sheep. I'm nobody important."

"The stones do not choose the important," the figure said. "They choose the necessary."

"Then they made a mistake." Kael's hands were shaking. He clenched them into fists, trying to stop the trembling. "Send me back. Choose someone else. There are knights in the capital, trained warriors, people who actually know what they're doing—"

"The knights are dead." The figure's voice was flat, emotionless. "The capital is burning. The Veil between worlds has torn, and the Hollow Ones are returning. You are the last choice, Kael of Thornhaven. You are the only choice."

The words hit him like a physical blow. "What?"

The figure raised one hand, and the glass beneath Kael's feet rippled like water. Images formed in its surface—cities in flames, people running and screaming, creatures of shadow and bone pouring through tears in reality itself. He saw the capital's white towers crumbling, saw the king's banner trampled in blood-soaked streets, saw things with too many limbs and not enough faces tearing through soldiers like they were made of paper.

"No." Kael fell to his knees, unable to look away from the carnage. "This isn't real. This is a nightmare. I'm still on the hill, I hit my head, I'm—"

"You are awake." The figure knelt beside him, and for the first time, Kael caught a glimpse of what lay beneath the hood. Not a face, but a constellation—stars and void and something that might have been eyes, once, before they'd seen too much. "And you are afraid. Good. Fear will keep you alive longer than courage ever could."

"I can't do this." Kael's voice was barely a whisper. "I'm not strong enough. I'm not brave enough. I'm just—"

"You are a shepherd," the figure interrupted. "You know how to guide the lost. You know how to stand between your flock and the wolves. You know how to endure the cold and the dark and the loneliness of the watch." It placed a hand on Kael's shoulder, and warmth flooded through him—not comfort, but something fiercer, something that burned. "That is all any hero has ever been."

The glass beneath them shattered, and Kael was falling through stars and screaming and light—

He hit the ground hard, gasping for air. Real ground this time, solid earth and grass and the familiar smell of sheep dung. The Shepherd's Stones loomed above him, silent now, their green glow faded to nothing.

But something had changed.

Kael held up his hands and watched in horror as symbols crawled across his skin—ancient runes that glowed with the same sickly green light as the stones. They moved like living things, spiraling up his arms, across his chest, burning themselves into his flesh. He tried to scream, but no sound came out. The pain was exquisite, unbearable, and then suddenly it was gone.

The runes remained, pulsing faintly with each beat of his heart.

"What did you do to me?" Kael shouted at the stones, but they offered no answer. They were just stones again, weathered and ancient and silent.

He staggered to his feet, his legs shaking. The sun was higher now—how long had he been gone? Minutes? Hours? The sheep were nowhere to be seen, and Master Orin would have his hide for losing them, but that seemed like the least of his problems now.

Kael looked down at his hands again, at the runes that marked him as something other than human. Something chosen. Something cursed.

"I don't want this," he said to the empty hillside.

But want had nothing to do with it.

A sound reached him from the valley below—screams, and the clash of steel, and something else. Something that made the runes on his skin burn hot and urgent. Kael turned toward Thornhaven and saw smoke rising from the village, black and thick against the morning sky.

The Hollow Ones had come.

And he was the only one who could stop them.

Kael took a deep breath, tasting ash and fear and something that might have been destiny. His legs wanted to run away, back to the safety of the hills, back to the simple life of sheep and solitude. But his feet carried him forward, down the slope, toward the smoke and the screaming and the darkness that waited.

He was nobody important.

He was just a shepherd.

But the stones had chosen him, and the world was burning, and someone had to stand between the flock and the wolves.

Even if that someone was terrified.

Even if that someone had no idea what he was doing.

Even if that someone was just a boy who'd never wanted to be a hero.

Kael ran toward Thornhaven, toward the smoke and the screams, toward a destiny he'd never asked for and didn't want. The runes on his skin blazed brighter with each step, and somewhere in the back of his mind, he could hear that ancient voice again:

*"The stones do not choose the important. They choose the necessary."*

He was necessary.

Gods help them all.
